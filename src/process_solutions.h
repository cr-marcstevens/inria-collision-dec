 * \brief Function called after each iteration that found one or more solutions

 * \param l Size of the window
 * \param BT Non permuted original matrix (r-l first rows truncated)
 * \param synds List of target syndromes
 * \param U Transition matrix that transformed HzeroT in partially eliminated form
 * \param perm_inv Inverse permutation of the current permutation
 * \param nb_iter Number of the current iteration
 * \todo Use isd_param struct
 * \todo change it so that it works only on one solution instead of a list (and change subisds so that they filter there list of solutions before returning)
